# TemperatureUnitConverter
COMP3710_Assignment1
Improve your first app as a unit converter for temperature (oC to/from oF), distance (km to/from mile), weight (kg to/from lb), and volume (litre to/from gallon).

Your app should have four pairs of textboxes (EditText components), each pair for a conversion type. When the user enters a value in a textbox, the converted value should appear in the corresponding textbox. Note that the conversion should be two-way. For example, if the user enters a value in the textbox for 'mile', the converted value should automatically appear in the textbox for 'km'. But if the user enters a value in the textbox for 'km', the converted value should appear in the textbox for 'mile'. Note: No buttons are needed to request the conversion.

Your app should also log the text change events. For example, if the user enters a value in the textbox for 'km', you should write in the log that event (the textbox with changed value, the timestamp, and the changed value).

1 (2p). Write four use-cases to describe the app requirements and sketch its UI.

2 (6p). Develop the app 3 (2p).

3 (2p). Test your app with each test case for one use case. Take the video or screenshot of your app in running.
